 Housing Price Prediction – Regression Project

This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset used is the **Kaggle Housing Prices Competition (Advanced Regression Techniques)**.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features such as number of rooms, total area, quality of materials, location, and more.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Kaggle Notebook

Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle and includes:
- `train.csv` – training data
- `test.csv` – data for prediction
- `sample_submission.csv` – sample submission format

Model Used
- Linear Regression (initial baseline)
- RandomForestRegressor / XGBoost (can improve performance)

I trained the model using:
- Data cleaning  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling  
- Model training and evaluation
